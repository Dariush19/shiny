Hello all :)
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  07:09 PM
had audio problems - machine reboot solved it
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  07:17 PM
what does "Focus/Parti" mean?
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  07:18 PM
Do we need to consider any security relate design or practise for presentation as web application?
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  07:18 PM
thanks
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:18 PM
@Conrad:The specificities feature in your visualisation.
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  07:18 PM
Thank you!
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:18 PM
@jian: No there is no need
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  07:20 PM
This is sounds like a waterfall software engeneering. if we realised some herdles in step 5 do we have redo again?
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  07:21 PM
Interesting point Jian, I had wondered whether this could be done (better?) using something like Agile
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  07:21 PM
@Callum, you are thinking what I’m thinking :)
From Me to Everyone:  07:22 PM
Agree. This is best achieved Agile.
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:47 PM
it’s look like bar chart in polar coordinates
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  07:50 PM
This is one of my favourite visualisations on climate change.
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:51 PM
That is interesting
From Brendon Carton to Everyone:  07:52 PM
Ed Hawkins is the brain behind these.
From Lin Mo to Everyone:  07:53 PM
mauna loa is in hawaii
From Brendon Carton to Everyone:  07:53 PM
Observations are from Hawaii.
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  07:54 PM
line might be better?
with color
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  07:54 PM
Depends on the audience. I'd like to see this one in a paper
I'd like to see the other one in a newspaper maybe
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:55 PM
depends on the audience
From Brendon Carton to Everyone:  07:55 PM
Northern hemisphere has more land, hence var.
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  07:55 PM
a classic!
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  07:56 PM
maybe a classic, but hard to read I reckon
From Brendon Carton to Everyone:  07:56 PM
Umm... no; very clear I think.
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  07:56 PM
I'll give him a pass for 1860
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  07:57 PM
A+
xkcd
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  07:57 PM
Primer is accurate
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  07:58 PM
I like that one
From Brendon Carton to Everyone:  07:59 PM
_Everyone_ should watch Primer. Several times.
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:59 PM
the wars give most interesting lines
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  07:59 PM
FYI Primer is a movie about time travel, hence the chaos
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:59 PM
arrow of time is absolute?
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  08:00 PM
wow
From Lin Mo to Everyone:  08:00 PM
x axis is time
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  08:00 PM
nice contrast levels
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  08:00 PM
categorical values L and P?
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  08:01 PM
who is driving before they get a learners license,...
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:01 PM
I think labelled time points, at which you get L or P
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  08:01 PM
maybe it's just meant to be scary ;)
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  08:01 PM
parallel axis?
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:02 PM
@Matthew: :)
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  08:03 PM
purpose is to kill reader’s time
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:03 PM
This looks like a circular distance matrix? They already clustered the sites by category...
From Brendon Carton to Everyone:  08:03 PM
Might work as a Motion Chart
From Lin Mo to Everyone:  08:03 PM
the lines don't represent quantitative values so unlikely parallel axis
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  08:04 PM
there is no direction for from and to ...
From Lin Mo to Everyone:  08:05 PM
I think its the other way around
nokia is not doing well
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:05 PM
No need for this to be circular, it could be much clearer as a Sankey plot
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:06 PM
I just don't like circular charts in general.
From Jafreen Hossain to Everyone:  08:07 PM
yeah the circular one is not clear
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  08:07 PM
Whenever I see a chart like the one on the left, I think of Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  08:07 PM
instruction: watch vedio
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  08:07 PM
Sure you can do it, but should you?
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:08 PM
"Instructions: Watch video" is probably a clue that your visualisation is not intuitive
From Jafreen Hossain to Everyone:  08:10 PM
Can we generate the data?
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:10 PM
Are we able to have access to a grading rubric?
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:11 PM
Yes, It would be available by tomorrow
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:11 PM
Thank you
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:12 PM
@Myrnelle: sorry I mean Marking Guide for Proposal assignment.
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:13 PM
Ah, thank you @Shirin
From Jafreen Hossain to Everyone:  08:15 PM
Rather than getting actual data from a source, can we generate that? will that be ok?
for Assignment 1?
ok thank you :) 
ok, thanks so much Shirin and Michael
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  08:16 PM
Kaggle datasets are fine?
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:16 PM
If scraping is part of the R code, I assume that would be no problem?
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  08:16 PM
if we need to submit the data, is there limit of data size?
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:17 PM
Okay thank you
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  08:17 PM
Thank you!
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:17 PM
What's the Moodle limit for file size?
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:17 PM
500 MB
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:17 PM
Thank you Shirin
From Darragh Ruddy to Me:  (Privately) 08:20 PM
Hi Dariush, do you still want to work on assingment 2 together?
From Kye Gregory to Everyone:  08:21 PM
how many Qs?
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:21 PM
Around 30
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:22 PM
What is the format of the quiz? Written answer or multiple choice?
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  08:22 PM
mc
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:22 PM
Thank you
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:22 PM
MC and short answer Michael just said
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:22 PM
I missed it, went to get a drink. Thanks for updating me!
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  08:22 PM
oops sorry, missed mc part (and I was here!)
the short answer rather
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:23 PM
Short answer and MCQ
From Brendon Carton to Everyone:  08:23 PM
Clean data?
From Minjoo Park to Everyone:  08:23 PM
for Assignment 3 does it need to be interactive or static will be OK ? 
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:24 PM
For As3, It should be interactive visualisation
@brendon: Sorry I did not get your question?
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:25 PM
Age
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  08:26 PM
whats diverging?
From Minjoo Park to Everyone:  08:26 PM
thanx Shirin 
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:28 PM
Irina, from the textbook: "diverging in which case it can be understood as two sequences going in opposite directions, e..g. like/dislike scales from -5 to 5 are diverging around the neutral value of 0"
From Myrnelle Jover to Everyone:  08:28 PM
Would diverging be like psych scales between -5 to 5?
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  08:28 PM
@Callum, thank you
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:28 PM
Likert scale
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  08:29 PM
deviation from the norm?
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  08:29 PM
complex number?
From Patrick Kelly to Everyone:  08:29 PM
with the key: value definition are we lumping structured documents into tabular - like JSON?
From Me to Darragh Ruddy:  (Privately) 08:29 PM
Hi Darragh. Sure. Yes. My email address: dria0001@monash.edu. Phone 0430930900
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  08:30 PM
so, degrees of rotation, what would that be?
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:30 PM
cyclical
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  08:30 PM
I was thinking that
but its also sequential?
and also goes both directions?
From Darragh Ruddy to Me:  (Privately) 08:31 PM
Great, I think this week is all about the quiz and getting data ready for assignment 1, so should we begin looking at assignment 2 after the quiz is done?
From Jafreen Hossain to Everyone:  08:32 PM

From Me to Darragh Ruddy:  (Privately) 08:32 PM
Sure. Yes. Thanks for that.
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:33 PM
@Matt I guess so, depends what's important - there might even be applications where total angle rotated through is important, not absolute positional rotation, so 360deg wouldn't be the same as 0 or 720
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:33 PM
So if JSON doesn't qualify, what about something like a document database, which has data represented in JSON but also has a defined (albeit flexible) schema?
From Darragh Ruddy to Me:  (Privately) 08:34 PM
Great :)
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  08:34 PM
thanks Conrad :)
From Brendon Carton to Everyone:  08:35 PM
Which one is applicable to your audience / readership?
From Lin Mo to Everyone:  08:35 PM
forrest plots
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  08:37 PM
without the slide, we don’t have the link for this week’s folder
or I missed sth
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  08:37 PM
we cant click, its a video feed
From Jafreen Hossain to Everyone:  08:38 PM
can we have the link here?
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  08:38 PM
could someone paste into chat?
From Zichao Zhang to Everyone:  08:38 PM
You can type the link
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  08:38 PM
