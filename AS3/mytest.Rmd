```{r me, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(dplyr)

covid_df <- read.csv('E:/Personal_Files/Dariush/monash/visual/AS3/new/time_series_covid19_ALL_global.csv', header=TRUE)
selectInput("CounryDropDown", "Please make a selection", choices = sort(unique(covid_df$Country)), selected = "Australia")
```
