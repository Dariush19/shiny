Hi Shirin
Thanks Shirin
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:10 PM
great!
wrangling in R? Or/and visualising?
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:11 PM
You can do wrangling in any software
Visualisation should be in R/D3
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  07:12 PM
Will much wrangling be required?
ok thanks
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:12 PM
You need to do wrangling but the main focus is on visualisation
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  07:16 PM
Michael/Shirin, when you talk about "interactive" visualisations, are you referring to the ability for the end user/audience to interact with the visualisation?
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:16 PM
yes
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  07:17 PM
Thank you
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:18 PM
Exactly
You will get a better idea of what is an Interactive visualisation during this TP
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  07:21 PM
Michael n - I wonder if your headphone cord could be arranged under your microphone hanging straight down. I'm getting a bit of noise on my end and I think that the cord movement is the cause
loud and clear, thanks
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  07:24 PM
yes looks wrong here
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  07:24 PM
looks clear to me
oh wait no
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  07:25 PM
 try wrangling that!
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:26 PM
having a great easter
From Shalaka Sakhardande to Everyone:  07:30 PM
Can we use python for assignment 1 and/or assignment 3?
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:30 PM
no
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  07:30 PM
So not allowed to use pandas to wrangle the data, for example?
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:31 PM
you mentioned something about group assignment?
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:31 PM
For Assignment 1 (Exploration and Wrangling part) it is fine to use python
But for Visualisation part you have to use R/D3
From Shalaka Sakhardande to Everyone:  07:31 PM
Thank you
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:31 PM
As2 is group Assignment
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  07:35 PM
isn’t Assignment 1 is linked to assignment 2? some if everyone in a group use different dataset , when goes to assignment 2, only one is remind for next stage?
*so
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  07:36 PM
Jiang, I believe Assignment 2 is separate from Assignments 1 & 3
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  07:36 PM
oh! Thank you Callum
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:36 PM
As1 is the first part of As3
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:36 PM
I wonder how is it submitted/assessed
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  07:37 PM
I vote we all self mark it ;)
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:37 PM
As2 is completely different
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  07:37 PM
Looking clear on pdf!

From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:47 PM
No coding
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  07:47 PM
Give me a bar chart any day
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  07:48 PM
strong dislike for making pie chart 3d...
From Gavin Bonello to Everyone:  07:48 PM
no use of time
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  07:48 PM
Hard to judge proportions
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  07:48 PM
no units or measurement
From Marcus Hudson to Everyone:  07:48 PM
no measure
From Lin Mo to Everyone:  07:48 PM
difficult to compare proportions
From Gavin Bonello to Everyone:  07:48 PM
the versions show progression of time
From Jafreen Hossain to Everyone:  07:48 PM
no data label
From Brodie Nicholson to Everyone:  07:48 PM
too many slices of pie
From Gavin Bonello to Everyone:  07:48 PM
piechart doesn't account for it
From Angus McCall to Everyone:  07:48 PM
hate pies
From Lachlan Gosper to Everyone:  07:48 PM
No actual proportions detailed
From Ramya Chandrasekaran to Everyone:  07:48 PM
too many features
From Lin Mo to Everyone:  07:48 PM
some slices too small
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:48 PM
hard to judge the area from a pie chart
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  07:48 PM
You can turn on your microphone
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  07:48 PM
hard to know which product came first
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  07:48 PM
Colours too close for blues
From Ramya Chandrasekaran to Everyone:  07:48 PM
3d
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  07:48 PM
no time dimension

From Jian Liang to Everyone:  07:48 PM
too many color could be hard to tell
From YANG LI to Everyone:  07:49 PM
no values
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  07:49 PM
colourblindness issues
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  07:49 PM
the tilted arrangement makes it hard to estimate magnitude of slices
From Minjoo Park to Everyone:  07:49 PM
no label 
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:49 PM
the same goes for a bar chart
From Anna Agati to Everyone:  07:49 PM

From Jafreen Hossain to Everyone:  07:49 PM
two blue colors - similar 
From Mohammad-Jawwad Ilyas to Everyone:  07:49 PM
Hard to estimate
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  07:50 PM
perspective!!
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  07:53 PM
Would be better if the legends were inline with the charts for the colour issues
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  07:53 PM
Agree with Darragh, the colours are redundant here
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  07:54 PM
x axis
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  07:54 PM
horizontal axis label
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  07:54 PM
no units  for y axis either - what is measured
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  07:54 PM
labels matching the bars
From Marcus Hudson to Everyone:  07:54 PM
would be better of the version names were on the blocks
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  07:54 PM
The horizontal axis should be adjusted to account for when the versions were released, so it represents time accurately
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  07:54 PM
Actual value still missing for some of bar
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  07:54 PM
I mean I would like to know more, size of features, duration of version, frequency of updates
From Lin Mo to Everyone:  07:56 PM
r\dataisbeautiful
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  07:56 PM
its a great subreddit Lin :D

really dislike: every violin plot ever
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:00 PM
That is really good exercise because you will get some idea on what you have to do in your final project and what you must avoid
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  08:01 PM
Visualization assists comprehension and to tell a story more effectively to stakeholders
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  08:01 PM
human eye 
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  08:01 PM
human could make sense of information through picture
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:01 PM
Speed of information - the eye can identify patterns more quickly in a lot of cases
From Tod Nestor to Everyone:  08:01 PM
seems easier to understand
From Jafreen Hossain to Everyone:  08:01 PM
we can see the unseen :) 
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  08:01 PM
We're visual creatures, it's more intuitive to view the entire data set visually than look at hundreds of rows of tabular data
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  08:02 PM
90% of information were learn from image
From Zichao Zhang to Everyone:  08:02 PM
Presentation for decision making
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:02 PM
I think for presentation it's essential
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  08:02 PM
the picture is worths 1000 words?
From Marcus Hudson to Everyone:  08:02 PM
It's difficult to see a trend in a table of numbers
From Angus McCall to Everyone:  08:02 PM
Difficult to convey ideas with just numbers, especially if they're large eg millions vs billions. 
From Dariush Riazati to Everyone:  08:02 PM
More effective is showing relations and association where individual precise measures are not that important.
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:02 PM
Good answers. Perfect. It seems we have a lots of expert. :)
From May Wong to Everyone:  08:02 PM
easier to capture targeted audience
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  08:03 PM
complementing
From Darragh Ruddy to Everyone:  08:03 PM
Showing information to non-technical shareholders
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:03 PM
These days we're trained visually too by devices and such, so visual stuff holds our attention
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:04 PM
some vis can be interactive too in a way that numbers & tables aren't.
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:18 PM
Is there a branch of science which is concerned with optimising visualisation of information?
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:20 PM
@Callum: It is a very good question. I am not sure but based on my knowledge I do not think there is.
From Lin Mo to Everyone:  08:20 PM
?Data Science
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  08:22 PM
yeah
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:27 PM
Are there core principles of visual design that inherently make one visualisation approach better than another? Does this unit go into that?
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  08:27 PM
Hans Rosling also wrote an excellent book called factfulness that is an enjoyable read
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:28 PM
Ed Tufte's books are great. The field of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_design
From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:28 PM
Thanks Conrad, I'll check it out
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:28 PM
In this unit we are only focused on FDS methodology. and we are going to use this approach as a one of the top and recommended approach.
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:29 PM
Also The Grammar of Graphics by Wilkinson (the gg in ggplot)
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  08:30 PM
why is the acronym for Five Sheet Design not FSD? Is the preferred term Five Design Sheets???
From Irina Lumsden to Everyone:  08:30 PM
you guys, know so much!
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:31 PM
Thanks for the recommended books
It is Five Design Sheet methodology
FDS
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  08:32 PM
ok Five Design Sheet and NOT Five Sheet Design
From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:32 PM
bummer the free desktop version of Tableau doesn't work on Linux though
From Shirin Ghaffarian Maghool to Everyone:  08:33 PM
@Peter: Yes
From Matthew Beilby to Everyone:  08:33 PM

From Conrad Leonard to Everyone:  08:33 PM
Thanks @Matt I'll check it out
From Jafreen Hossain to Everyone:  08:34 PM
SAS is good as well :) 
From Jian Liang to Everyone:  08:34 PM

From Callum Lynch to Everyone:  08:35 PM
PowerBI is particularly good for Azure cloud integration
From Dariush Riazati to Everyone:  08:35 PM
Latest version of Cognos is catching up.
From Peter McEniery to Everyone:  08:39 PM
